# This is my code for Complex Adaptive Systems year 1
This repository contains code for the courses offered in the first year of the Complex Adaptive Systems masterprogram at Chalmers. I am sharing these solutions to help others who may be stuck on similar problems or want to learn from my approach to solving them. However, I would like to emphasize that these solutions are not intended to be copied directly.

FFR105 - Stochastic optimization  
FFR120 - Simulation of complex systems  
TIF155 - Dynamical systems  
FFR110 - Computational biology
