ASssignment 2
make changes only to the 2 microservices
keep the kiwi microservices for sumulation slide  only change n√§st sista och 3e sista

3 main prob
how everythong fits together
what messages to send and whera
keep track of time

opendlvtestlogic.cpp

change auto atFrequenzy
create a timevariable outside and link in to lambda and update for ecerystep
instead of gsangle and pedal request get wheel speed
instead of 0 so set sendersstamp with time

in motor we want to recive the message we sent
two data triggers ground and pedal. Will not be the same since looking for other message.
Greate a new differentialy steered class instead of the one now

Send kinematic state (velocities)
Dont have to integrate because its handled in the later states so just send velocities
